# 📝 Description
## Tasks:
- Transform the initial table into First Normal Form (1NF).
- Transform the resulting tables into Second Normal Form (2NF).
- Transform the resulting tables into Third Normal Form (3NF).
- Design an ER diagram based on the normalized tables.

💡 Use clear and specific names for entities and attributes. Specify data types for all attributes. Ensure that all relationships and attributes have clear cardinalities and meaningful values.

- Using the ER diagram, create the corresponding tables in a database.
- Define the structure without inserting any data — only the columns and their relationships, either manually or using automated tools.
